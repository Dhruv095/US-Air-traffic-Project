## Introduction

The United States' air transportation system plays a pivotal role in connecting people and goods across the nation and around the world. Over the past three decades, from 1990 to 2020, the aviation industry has witnessed significant growth, evolution, and various challenges. Analyzing US air traffic data during this period provides valuable insights into the industry's dynamics, trends, and overall performance.

This data analysis aims to explore key aspects of US air traffic, including flight departures, passenger travel patterns, busiest flight routes, and the influence of various factors on air travel demand. By examining this extensive dataset, we seek to uncover meaningful patterns and draw informed conclusions about the evolution of air travel in the United States.

Throughout this analysis, we will utilize various statistical and data visualization techniques to present the information in a clear and comprehensible manner. Understanding the changes and fluctuations in US air traffic over the past thirty years can shed light on the impact of economic, technological, and societal factors on the aviation sector.

The findings from this study can be beneficial to aviation authorities, airlines, policymakers, and other stakeholders as they make informed decisions about improving air transportation infrastructure, optimizing flight schedules, and enhancing overall passenger experience.

Let us embark on this journey of analyzing the US air traffic data, exploring the trends, challenges, and successes that have shaped the skies over the past three decades.
